WorkoutApp

This is a project that I am creating for founders who are interested in tracking workout data for gymgoers. The app collects metrics as users enter their information after completing an exercise. It can recommend optimal sets and time intervals for progressive overload. Additionally the app contains a scanning feature to redirect the user to a specific machine after scanning a custom QR code.
